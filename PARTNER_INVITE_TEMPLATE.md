# Partner Testing Invitation - AI FACTORY

## Quick Copy-Paste Message Templates

### Template 1: Initial Invitation (Casual)

```
Hey [Name]!

I'd love your help testing something I've been building - it's called AI FACTORY, an autonomous MVP generator.

You'd be the FIRST person to test it (besides me), so your feedback would be super valuable!

Here's how it works:
1. Click this link: https://condensative-irreplaceable-makhi.ngrok-free.dev
2. You'll see a welcome screen explaining everything
3. Create a simple project (like "todo app")
4. Watch it build autonomously through 6 phases
5. Download the completed project

Takes about 30-45 minutes total. No technical knowledge needed.

Free right now when you're free for a quick test? I can walk you through it on a call if you want!

Let me know!
```

Hi [Name],

I'm inviting you to be among the first testers of AI FACTORY - an autonomous MVP generation platform I've been developing.

- Honest feedback on the user experience
- Tell me what's confusing, what's missing, what works well

**How to access:**

The interface has a welcome screen that explains everything. You can either:

- Use one of the example templates provided

**Incentive:**
If you provide detailed feedback, I'll give you:
- Free access for 3 months when we launch
